# idea-book

The idea of this idea book comes [from Zach](https://github.com/zachleat/idea-book), thanks for the inspiration!

Just like him, and many other, I love Side Projects. I learn a lot through Side Projects.

An important part of brainstorming ideas for Side Projects is to have an Idea Book. I’ve decided to make my Idea Book public. Ideas are logged as [issues (sorted by 👍)](https://github.com/nhoizey/idea-book/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc). This is simply a dump of ideas for Side Projects that I’m putting out here for public feedback. I welcome your comments and votes 👍 or 👎 on project ideas.
